  "abstract": "This thesis investigates two advanced autonomous systems designed for environmental management: coordinated UAV swarms for wildlife deterrence and adaptive geological sampling techniques. Both projects demonstrate how intelligent autonomous systems can address real-world challenges more effectively than traditional approaches.\n\nIn the first part, we develop a biomimetic UAV swarm control framework that mimics predator hunting behaviors to create more effective wildlife deterrence, particularly for airport safety applications. The system achieves 91% effectiveness in bird dispersal at test sites, representing a significant improvement over current methods. The implementation includes a physics-based simulation environment and a C++ control toolkit that enables coordinated multi-drone operations under challenging field conditions.\n\nThe second part presents an adaptive sampling methodology for geological surveying that incorporates machine learning to optimize information gathering in mining exploration. By leveraging Gaussian Processes and ensemble methods, the system demonstrates a 40% reduction in required sampling while maintaining equivalent model confidence. Field validation confirmed the practical applicability of the approach in real-world mining scenarios.\n\n*Note: This thesis contains intellectual property that is subject to patent applications and confidentiality agreements with industry partners. Certain implementation details have been omitted in accordance with these agreements.*",
