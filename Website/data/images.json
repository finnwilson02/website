So who wants to kill a chicken?\" Thinking I'd get to behead it, my hand shot up. I had to go to the village and chase it. These mfs have a crazy change of pace, they would be lethal on the wing (no pun intended). Hence the action shot. Turns out I actually had to snap its neck with my bare hands which wasn't as cool. All the vegans in the group were crying at this point, but shout out to Ashley for being my assistant and pouring the boiling water on it to get rid of the feathers, since none of the other guys would. Said water actually made it start flying, even though its neck was broken and its head was dangling around from its body. Pretty crazy. After that whole ordeal the curry we made from it was pretty bony and tough anyway. But no one can tell me I don't know where my meat comes from.\n",

Getting to see a blue whale up close was incredible. There are only a couple thousand in the arctic, of which maybe 100 pass through Icelandic waters annually on their way to arctic feeding grounds, before going all the way to the Caribbean to breed in winter. They are also very shy, hence the difficulty getting a photo that truly captures their scale.  ",
