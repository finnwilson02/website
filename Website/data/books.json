    "review": "An interesting and well-crafted novel, though its meaning isn\u2019t immediately clear - at least in English.\r\n\r\n With no prior knowledge of Mishima, the book might read as a nebulous warning against dispassion, youthful arrogance, the pursuit of glory, and rebellion against domestication. Understanding Mishima\u2019s life and how he speaks through his characters - particularly Noboru - reveals something more disconcerting. Rather than condemning these ideas, he endorses them, presenting their 'consequences' not as tragedy but as fate asserting itself as it should.\r\n\r\n I kept waiting for Noboru to be met with some grand consequence for being coerced by The Chief into cruelty and hubris. It was only with 10 pages left - on the edge of my seat, waiting for the twist - that I realised there would be no repercussions. In Mishima's worldview, the mundanity and inertia of post-war Japan is evil, while violence, rejection of conventional morality and self-sacrifice in the name of glory are truly heroic.\r\n\r\nFor me, this made the novel more compelling. Mishima's ability to articulate ideas that are widely unpalatable to modern society with such artistry and conviction is rare and exhilarating - but it certainly isn\u2019t for the faint-hearted.\r\n\r\nA side note: one of the most striking cultural contrasts when visiting Japan is how frequently people offer polite apologies for even minor inconveniences. In The Sailor, not a single character apologises. This is no accident - Mishima clearly saw modern social norms, particularly the expectation to suppress oneself for the comfort of others, as contemptible."
