  <h2>Hello! I'm Finn.</h2>
  <p>
    I recently graduated from the University of Sydney with a <strong>B.Eng. (Hons I)</strong> in Mechatronics/Space Engineering and a <strong>B.Sc. (Advanced)</strong> in Physics. My research interests include decentralised multi-agent robotics, distributed control, and machine learning applied to complex real-world problems.
  </p>

  <p>Currently, I'm involved in several research projects, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Magnetodynamic Flocking for UAV-Based Bird Deterrence</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Intelligent ML-based Sampling Strategies for Mineral Exploration</strong> (in collaboration with Rio Tinto)</li>
    <li><strong>Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems for Legal Decision-Support</strong> (applied AI consulting)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Previously, I worked as a Systems Engineer at Raytheon Australia, contributing to upgrades of the Australian Defence Air Traffic System and internal automation solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the near future, I plan to pursue a PhD specialising in distributed autonomous robotic systems.<br>
