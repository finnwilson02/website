  <h2>Hello! I'm Finn.</h2>
  <p>
    I recently completed my <strong>B.Eng (Hons I) in Mechatronics/Space</strong> and 
    <strong>B.Sc (Advanced) in Physics</strong> at the <strong>University of Sydney</strong>. 
    My research focuses on <strong>multi-agent systems, distributed control, and machine learning for robotics and industrial optimisation</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently, I'm a <strong>systems engineer at Raytheon Australia</strong>, working on upgrades to the 
    <strong>Australian Defence Air Traffic System (ADATS)</strong> and developing automation solutions for internal processes. 
    I'm also writing two journal articles:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Reducing Risk-Weighted Cost of Mineral Exploration Using Intelligent Machine Learning-Based Sample Placement</em></li>
    <li><em>Magnetodynamic Flocking for UAV-Based Bird Deterrence</em></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In the near future, I plan to pursue a <strong>PhD in distributed intelligent systems</strong>. If any of this interests you, feel free to get in touch.
