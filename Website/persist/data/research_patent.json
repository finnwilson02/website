    "abstract": "This patent application covers novel methods for determining optimal sampling locations in geological exploration using adaptive machine learning techniques. The system iteratively recommends sampling locations to maximize information gain while minimizing exploration costs, leveraging Gaussian Processes and ensemble learning to quantify uncertainty and guide decision-making in resource exploration campaigns.\n\nThe disclosed system incorporates multiple innovations:\n\n1. A multi-objective optimization algorithm that balances information gain against operational constraints such as accessibility, equipment limitations, and budget considerations.\n\n2. A novel uncertainty quantification method that combines predictions from heterogeneous models to provide more reliable confidence estimates than traditional methods.\n\n3. An adaptive weighting scheme that progressively refines the importance of different geological indicators based on observed correlations with actual resource measurements.\n\n4. A decision support interface that generates field-ready sampling plans with visualizations of expected information gain and uncertainty reduction.\n\nThe methods described in this patent application have demonstrated significant efficiency improvements in field trials, potentially reducing exploration costs by up to 40% while maintaining or improving confidence in resource characterization.",
