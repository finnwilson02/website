    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to underwater change detection using neural networks specifically designed to overcome challenges from variable water conditions, lighting, and lack of rigid structures. The method achieves robust detection performance in environments where traditional computer vision techniques struggle, offering potential applications in marine conservation, underwater infrastructure monitoring, and autonomous underwater vehicle navigation.\n\nWe trained a specialized convolutional neural network on a diverse dataset collected from the Great Barrier Reef, incorporating variations in water turbidity, sunlight penetration, and seasonal changes. Our model achieved 87% accuracy in identifying structural changes in coral reef environments across varying conditions, outperforming existing methods that typically average 65-70% accuracy in similar scenarios.\n\nKey contributions include a custom data augmentation pipeline that simulates underwater visual distortions, a multi-scale feature extraction architecture that captures both fine details and contextual information, and a temporal consistency module that reduces false positives from temporary environmental variations.\n\nThe system was deployed on an experimental AUV platform, demonstrating real-time performance with modest computational resources, making it suitable for long-duration underwater monitoring missions with applications in ecology, underwater archaeology, and offshore infrastructure inspection.",
